### Advantages

- Fast deploy
- Add bio to you API response
- Minified response version
- Not Elixir `ヽ(￣ω￣(。。 )ゝ`
- The list will be constantly expanding, because I have a lot of ideas.

### Deploy

1. Make sure that you've installed Docker on your PC
2. Fill [.env](.env.example) file
3. `docker compose up --build`
4. Enjoy `(⁄ ⁄>⁄ ▽ ⁄<⁄ ⁄)`

### Understaning

Api description (Swagger) is located at `{{protocol}}://{{baseUrl}}/api`

> Examlple
> `http://localhost:3333/api`


# Security
To get an access key for changing bio, write to the bot `/api`
